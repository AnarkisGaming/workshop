# workshop
A GitHub Action to upload items to the Steam Workshop

## Use it
You'll need to upload your addon using the Workshop tools of the game/app you're looking to submit to first. Then, create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` with something that resembles the following:

```yaml
name: "Upload to Workshop"

on:
  - push

jobs:
  upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: AnarkisGaming/workshop@v1
        with:
          appID: 727570
          publishedFileID: 2095592756
        env:
          STEAM_ACCOUNT_NAME: ${{ secrets.accountname }}
          STEAM_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.password }}
```
